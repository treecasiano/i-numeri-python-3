# I Numeri

This program runs in the terminal (for now) and quizzes you on random Italian numbers between 1 and 9999. I wrote it because I wanted to improve both my Python and my Italian skills simultaneously. It gave me good practice in iterating over Python dictionaries and using Python string methods. 

The next step is to recreate it with JavaScript and turn it into a flashcard web app of some kind, probably using React and Firebase.
