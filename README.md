# I Numeri (Python 3)

This Python 3 program runs in the terminal and quizzes you on random Italian numbers between 1 and 9999.

I wrote it because I wanted to improve both my Python and my Italian skills simultaneously. It gave me good practice in iterating over Python dictionaries and using Python string methods.

 I'm now using this logic to create a Node.app. The repo for the new version can be found here: [I Numeri](https://github.com/treecasiano/inumeri).
